# How do i navigate in a Windows cmd (command Line).md

To navigate in a Windows Command Prompt (cmd), you can use several basic commands:

### Change Directory (cd)

The cd command allows you to change the current directory to another directory within the file system. For example, to change to a directory named "Documents", you would type:
```cmd
cd Documents
```
### Going up one level 

If you want to go up one level in the directory hierarchy, you can use:
```cmd
cd ..
```

### Return to root 

To go to the root of the current drive, use:
```cmd
cd \
```

### Navigating several folders into the drive 

If you need to change to a specific directory, you can use the full path:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
```

### List Directory Contents (dir)

To view the contents of a directory, use the dir command:
```cmd
dir
```

### Change Drives

To change the drive, simply type the drive letter followed by a colon:
```cmd
D:
```

### Launch an Application

To launch an application, navigate to the folder containing the executable and type the program's name:
```cmd
control.exe
```

Remember, these are just a few basic commands to get started with navigating in cmd. There are many more commands and options available for file and directory manipulation, launching applications, and managing system processes
